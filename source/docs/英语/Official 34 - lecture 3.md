Listen to part of lecture in a **botany** class. 

> Botany: pant science, plant biology or phytology. 

When we talk about **pollination ecology**, we're talking about the relationship between a plant and its **pollinator**.

For the plant perspective, the ideal pollinator is the animal that is under fed, ready to eat and in a hurry. 

the pollinator on the  other hand, **wants to remain well fed with as litter effort as possible**. 

these factors help drive the evolution of plants and their pollinators, both of which depend on **this balanced and delicate relationship**. 

Sometimes, only certain **insect**s or birds can pollinate certain **plant species**. So to really understand **pollination ecology**, both the flower and its pollinators must be studied. 

Let's start with flowers, there were several important factors associated with pollination. 

when and how often a pant flowers, how long the flowering cycle lasts, and the number of flowers that open at the same time. 

For example, flowering may **coincide with the migration** of a certain animal species that pollinates the plant. 

> coincide: to occupy the same place in space or time. 

or producing many flowers **at once** may increase the number of pollinators a plant attracts.

Other characteristics of flowers are also important.

Features such as color, **scent**, and shape attract pollinators, **as does the reward in the flower**--the **pollen** or the **nectar**--that feeds the pollinator.

For example, flowers that attract **bat**s tend to be green or cream colored

because visibility isn't important...bats are practically **blind**, remember... and these flowers **bloom** at night, when bats are active.

there's a flower in the **Amazon rain forest** called a royal water lily, and the characteristics of its flowers change during the pollination process.

The royal water lily uses color, temperature, and **scent** to attract the **beetles** that pollinate it.

When the flowers of the royal water lily first open up, when they first bloom, they're white. They also **emit a strong odor**, and their temperature rises.

producing heat **serves two purposes**: it magnifies the **scent** of the flower and it helps the beetles maintain their body temperature.

> an odor left by an animal on a surface passed over
>
> a characteristic or particular odor

When a **beetle** arrives at the flower, the flower closes around it for about 24 hours so that the beetle becomes covered with pollen.

Then, when the flower opens, its color changes to red, and it **cools down**. When the beetle flies out, it carries the pollen to a different heated, white, **fragrant** flower.

> fragrant: having a sweet or pleasant smell.

> synonyms: aromatic, perfumed, scented. 

As you can see, plants go to a lot of trouble to attract attention. So what kind of attention are they attracting, and why?

sometimes flowers provide **shelter** for insects... a place to lay eggs, for instance.

But usually the attraction is food... nectar and pollen. **Nectar** is mainly **a sugar solution**, while pollen is a **grain** made up of part of the **plant-cell structure**.

In both nectar and pollen production, quality and quantity **vary over time**, but they're always related to the needs of the pollinator.

You can see that the relationships between pollinators and plants are delicate, so any number of factors can disturb them.

human development is one, and **agriculture** is generally believed to be the most harmful.

**It can fragment habitats** in a variety of ways, reducing the number of pollinators. 

which **in turn** may reduce the number or size of the flowers, which of course affects the animals that feed on them.

**exotic plant species**, not native to the area, can move in and compete... even bees brought in to pollinate crops can **alter** **natural pollen-dispersal systems** of rain-forest plants.

On the other hand, recent studies have shown that the disruption of **one aspect of** the pollination cycle doesn't usually lead to the **extinction** of other species

**it turns out that** plant-pollinator relationships are more **adaptable** to change than we thought.
