# Official 38 - lecture 4

Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class. 

Last week, we discussed the formation of Earth and the other rocky planets, of planets  in the inner solar system.

what about the gas giants? 

Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

well there are two theories.

But first, let's **recap**.

we believe our solar system began as a huge spinning cloud of dust and gas, which flattened and eventually collapsed in on itself.

the matter it's centered **condensed** into a ball of hot gas and dust, eventually becoming our sun.  

and what happened to the remaining could?

to the **disk** encircling the sun when it was a young star.

the rocky planets were born.

dust, little grains of rocks and metal within the disk **collided** with each other and stuck together, and this process sort of **snowballed** over millions of years until the **chunks** grew into mini-planets, **proto-**planets. 

this process is called accretion.

and we call the disk an **accretion disk**.

now, think of it as two parts: an inner accretion disk, and an outer accretion disk.

in the inner part, once an object gets large enough, that object's gravitational field gets stronger, which speeds up the accretion process. 

You know, larger objects attract smaller ones and sort of **gobble** them up.

And eventually, you get a full-sized planet in its own **orbit**.

Okay. That's how the inner rocky planets probably formed by accretion.

But what about those gas planets in the outer solar system, in the outer accretion disk?

Well, the first theory says the accretion process was similar to the one that formed the rocky planets, with some key differences.

Remember, the gas giants are **farther** from the sun, where temperatures are much colder.

So, in the outer accretion disk, **compound**s like water and **ammonia** exist in frozen form.
