This is administrative office, right?

well, how can I help you?

**I'm stopping by** reverse to a working place for my school club for the meeting work. Pretty much on the basis. Ideally, our preference is to have our own office.

well **we are out of private offices**. But we do have some semi-private offices available.

It is a setup where there is a large space shared by two other clubs. In other words, each club has their own space within one room. 

Are there any **divider walls** or anything?

there will be a couple of dividers, so there is some privacy.

we'll work with then, I won't wanna be without an office.

here are the tow forms you have to fill out. **why don't you do it now** while I set that up through our computer system?

so, what's the club name, ant the last name of club president. 

it's the photography club, and it's Willians. 

that's not pulling up anything on my screen. Let me try something else. how about your faculty advisor's name?

 your club didn't show up on online records, isn't it an established club? 

have you completed the registration process?

that was my very first step.

**for my proposes**, a club definitely has to be registered before i can **proceed further**. At the moment, however, it appears that there is no record of your club's registration. 

I found everything was finalized last week. 

usually there is 24-hour turnaround in our computer database. 

do you have a registration approval from the review committee? that will give me the verification I need. 

I don't have with me, but I can get it from my dorm room, bring it back with me, and submit it with forms you need form me. 

university gives us the permission to setup a website, I wanna get students sharing their ideas on the website, you know, establish a photography Blog.  

you will be allowed to audio-visual equipment at no cost.

you will receive club mail box and email address, **you will be allowed to post you flyers and posts around university for publicity**.  And you could be **eligible for** funding club events. 

we will definitely interest in hiring professional speaker at one of  our campus events at same point in the semester. 

and speaker almost always **charge a fee**, I will definitely fellow up on that.
