conversation between student and art history professor

how was the museum 

great, I have been there for few years

did you enjoy the  Van Gogh(梵高) painting?

that's the thing, looks like I have to change my topic

we are getting to close to the deadline.

you were writing about the theme of night in painting of **Vincent van Gogh**? It's a wonderful topic.

 I know, people don't usually think VG as an artist of **nocturnal** themes

> nocturnal adj. 夜间发生的

they think of brightness, sunshine, all that yellow and orange.

you are right, about intense light associated with day time paintings but **his night paintings don't exactly lack brightness**.

that the **paradox** that I really like, the paradox of painting a nighttime scene using so much color and light.

> paradox: one person, situation or action having seemingly contradictory qualities of phases. 

so **I was planning to** focus mostly on his painting **Starry Night**. 

but 

when i went to the museum to look at  the actual painting, like you told me to, it wasn't there. 

really, isn't it a part of **permanent collection**. 

yes, but **it's on loan right now** to museum in Europe. 

I see, I am strict about having student write about the painting they can observed firsthand. 

-----

well I found another painting I can study instead.

Ok, I read there are two painting called starry night. 

the first one was done by French **realist painter** Millet.  it may've been the inspiration for Van Gogh's painting. 

Millet's painting is located near my family's house in **Connecticut**. and I am going there this weekend, and could study it then. 

> Connecticut: 康乃狄克州

I made sure that **it's not out on loan**. 

that would definitely work then, VG copied many of Millet's **compositions**.

we know that he really admired Millet's work.

and a lot of us think Van Goah saw this particular painting by Millect in Paris in the late 1700s

> 1700s: seventeen hundreds

although Millet was realist painter and Van Goah a postimpressionist , the two painting still share lots of features, not just the name. 

the most **striking** shared feature has been got to the amazing light effects. 

> striking: very unusual or easily noticed, and therefore attracting a lot of attention. 

I'm excited to go see it, but one other thing. 

I was thinking about **getting head start of my next assignment** while I'm at the  gallery in Connecticut, the assignment on **miniatures**. 

> miniature: 微观模型

they have a lot of miniature portraits of children as a part of permanent collection. 

American miniatures?

so I figure that I also get started on that essay, study a few while I'm there. 

I focus on the meaning of object that some of children are holding, some are holding flower,  one child has rattle, and another with toy violin. 

> rattle: 拨浪鼓

that would be fine, those objects we call them attributes. 

the attributes chosen to included in particular miniature **was often meant to** the communicate parent hopes and dream for their child. 

> is meat to: it is expected to happen

so I think you'll learn a lot about how people viewed children **at time of** miniature painting were done.
